# Egeria

My Egeria - Refactored TUI
=========================

A textual user interface for Egeria.

Built on textual and pyegeria packages.

Startup behaviour:
- Reads environment variables EGERIA_SERVER and EGERIA_BASE_URL, EGERIA_USER, and EGERIA_USER_PASSWORD
- to use as defaults (primnarily for the Egeria demo environment), also presents, following a splash screen,  
- a login screen for a user to provide their own specific values.
- 
- Requires both 'pyegeria' and textual from Pypi, along with their dependencies to be installed.

See https://egeria-project.org for the main Egeria Documentation.

This is a new repository that we are currently setting up. 

A longer description and additional content should be added here over time.
